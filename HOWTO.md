## Usage

There are 3 roles:
1. Attester:
-  Visit the front-end after installing the above at ```http://localhost:3000```. 
- Paste the GPT API KEY in the top input field.
- Type or paste the question.
- Click on the button labeled "Query GPT-3.5-Turbo". The query will run and produce an answer and IPFD CID below the answers.
- Click on Request Attestation. The wallet (MetaMask) will ask you to sign the transaction. This transaction pulls the authorized amount as Bond.
- Once the dispute period is over, Settlement should be automated calling ```setSettleAssertion```. 

2. Disputer
- Pick up the Attestation ID and the which was generated as an event, also available on the web site.
- Run the utility:
```
cd challenge-dispute
node challenge.js <Attestation ID>
```
- Dispute the transaction by paying a bond based on th information from the above script and calling ```disputeAssertion(bytes32 assertionId, address disputer)```.


3. Voter
- Pick up the Attestation ID and the which was generated as an event, also available on the web site.
- Run the utility:
```
cd challenge-dispute
node challenge.js <Attestation ID>
```
This script outputs a confidence factor, which would help the voting decisions, and the voting itself can be automated based on the output from the above script.

For all automated participants, they can listen to the event ```DataAsserted(dataId, data, asserter, assertionId)``` to look for new opportunities (found in this repo in ```AIAttestationAsserter```; copied from samples). In this event, the IPFS CID is packed into the fields ```dataId``` and ```data``` concatenated (it's 46 bytes) and padded with spaces. This ```CID``` can be passed as the only parameter to ```challenge.js``` above.

The entire dispute process can be seen on the [UMA dashboard](https://mumbai.oracle.uma.xyz/).
